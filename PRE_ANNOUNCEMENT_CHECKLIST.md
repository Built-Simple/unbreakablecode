- [ ] Run `python test_pypi_package.py` - Test actual PyPI package

### Or run all at once:
- [ ] Run `RUN_ALL_TESTS.bat` - Complete test battery

## üîç VERIFY FUNCTIONALITY

### Core Features
- [ ] IndexError prevention works
- [ ] KeyError prevention works
- [ ] TypeError prevention works
- [ ] ZeroDivisionError prevention works
- [ ] AttributeError prevention works
- [ ] Custom fallback values work
- [ ] Convenience decorators work
- [ ] No performance issues (<50% overhead)

### PyPI Package

- [ ] Import works without errors
- [ ] Decorators function correctly
- [ ] No dependency conflicts

## üìù DOCUMENTATION CHECK

### README on PyPI

- [ ] Code examples are correct
- [ ] Links are valid

### Package Metadata
- [ ] Version is correct (2.0.0)
- [ ] Author info is appropriate
- [ ] License is specified
- [ ] Keywords are relevant

## üéØ EDGE CASES TO TEST

```python
# Test these specific scenarios:

# 1. Empty function
@self_healing
def empty():
    pass

# 2. Already working function
@self_healing
def working():
    return "success"

# 3. Nested errors
@self_healing
def nested():
    data = None
    return data["key"]["subkey"] / 0

# 4. Generator function
@self_healing
def gen():
    yield 1
    raise ValueError()
    yield 2

# 5. Async function (if needed)
@self_healing
async def async_func():
    return await broken_async_call()
```

## üöÄ ANNOUNCEMENT PREP

### GitHub Repository (Optional but Recommended)
- [ ] Create repo at github.com/yourusername/unbreakablecode
- [ ] Upload source code
- [ ] Add README with examples
- [ ] Add LICENSE file
- [ ] Create releases page

### Social Media Posts Ready
- [ ] Reddit r/Python post drafted
- [ ] HackerNews submission prepared
- [ ] Twitter/X thread written
- [ ] LinkedIn post (if applicable)

### Support Channels
- [ ] Email for questions ready
- [ ] GitHub issues enabled (if using)
- [ ] Discord/Slack (optional)

## üé® MARKETING MATERIALS

### Demo Code
```python
# The perfect demo that shows the value:

from unbreakable import self_healing

# Without @self_healing - crashes
def normal_function():
    data = {"users": [{"name": "Alice"}]}
    return data["users"][10]["name"]  # IndexError!

# With @self_healing - never crashes
@self_healing
def safe_function():
    data = {"users": [{"name": "Alice"}]}
    return data["users"][10]["name"]  # Returns None

# Show the difference
try:
    normal_function()
    print("Normal: Success")
except:
    print("Normal: üí• CRASHED!")

result = safe_function()
print(f"Safe: Returns {result} (no crash!)")
```

### Key Selling Points
- ‚úÖ One decorator to prevent all crashes
- ‚úÖ Zero configuration needed
- ‚úÖ Works with existing code
- ‚úÖ Minimal performance overhead
- ‚úÖ 3.3M Stack Overflow solutions (with API)

### Target Audiences
1. **Beginners** - "Stop debugging, start coding"
2. **Data Scientists** - "Focus on analysis, not error handling"
3. **Web Developers** - "APIs that never return 500"
4. **DevOps** - "Services that stay up"

## üîí SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS

- [ ] No sensitive data in code
- [ ] No API keys exposed
- [ ] No personal information visible
- [ ] Safe for production use

## üìä SUCCESS METRICS TO TRACK

### After Launch
- PyPI download statistics
- GitHub stars (if applicable)
- Reddit upvotes/comments
- HackerNews points/comments
- Bug reports/issues
- Feature requests

### Response Templates

**For bugs:**
"Thanks for reporting! I'll look into this. Can you share the specific error and code that caused it?"

**For feature requests:**
"Great idea! I'll add it to the roadmap. The package is open for contributions too!"

**For praise:**
"Glad it's helping! Built this because I was tired of the same crashes everyone hits."

**For criticism:**
"Thanks for the feedback! This is my first package, always looking to improve. What would make it better for your use case?"

## ‚úÖ FINAL CHECKS

- [ ] Package works on Python 3.7+
- [ ] No import errors on fresh install
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Ready for user questions
- [ ] Backup of all code exists

## üéâ YOU'RE READY!
