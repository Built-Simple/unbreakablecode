# UnbreakableCode üõ°Ô∏è

**Makes Python literally uncrashable.**

## The Money Shot

```python
from unbreakablecode import self_healing

# THIS SHOULD CRASH PYTHON
@self_healing
def chaos():
    return 1/0 + [][999] + None.lol + int("not a number")

print(chaos())  # Returns None. Refuses to elaborate. Leaves.
```

## The Origin Story
I got tired of writing try/except blocks everywhere. So I made a decorator that catches EVERYTHING.

## Installation
```bash
pip install unbreakablecode
```

## Basic Usage
```python
from unbreakablecode import self_healing

@self_healing
def dangerous_function():
    return 1/0  # This won't crash anymore

result = dangerous_function()  # Returns None instead of exploding
```

## How It Works
1. Decorator catches ALL exceptions
2. Queries fixitAPI.dev for known solutions  
3. Falls back to pattern matching
4. Returns None as last resort
5. Your code keeps running no matter what

## The Ironic Bug
Version 2.0.0 crashed on import due to Unicode errors. The "unbreakable" package broke itself. Version 2.0.1 fixes this.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è PRODUCTION WARNING ‚ö†Ô∏è

**DO NOT USE THIS IN:**
- Banking systems
- Healthcare applications  
- Aircraft control systems
- Nuclear power plants
- Life support systems
- Anything where failure = people die

**WHY?** Because hiding errors instead of fixing them is like putting duct tape over your check engine light. Technically it works. Morally questionable.

**BUT** if you're building a weekend project or "learning" application, go wild. It's actually pretty useful for rapid prototyping.

## Stats
- Built in 30 days while learning Python
- Prevents 100% of crashes
- Probably cursed
- Definitely works

## License
MIT - Because error handling should be free
